I think it is a good moment to formalize my Azure knowledge and pass some Microsoft Azure Exams. I have two on my list.  `AZ-900 - Azure Fundamentals` and `AZ-204 - Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure`. I would like to share with you my learning process. There will be couple of articles about my path. It is the 1st one.

## Where am I?
I have been a software developer for 15 years and I had 1st contact with Azure far far ago, I think it was 2011. Since that time a lot of were changed. Both of us, me and Azure, became mature and experienced. 

I was creating applications hosted on Azure and configuring automatic pipelines which requested for new resources automatically. I know concepts and how it is build, but it is not a deep, conscious skill. I want to go deeper and share it with you. eg. I know I have some gaps in topics like networking, storage, and EntraID, RBAC, AD and cost calculating. I am going to fill these gaps.

These series of articles will summarize what I know, what I learn, what I discovered, what is required to pass the exam. I am use that these articles will be updated during my learning path and experience growth.


### Do I have a plan? 
Yes, my plan is:
1. Find the best resources to learn 
2. Watch Adam's course and make some notes
3. Check my knowledge with MS page
4. Watch another course
5. Take the practice assessment
6. Pass the exam `AZ-900`
7. Repeat the steps for `AZ-204`

## Resources to learn
After a bit of investigation and I found some nice resources to learn. 

The best options to start getting information about Microsoft Azure is to visit Microsoft pages. Here is a basic list of then:
- [Microsoft page about AZ-900 exam](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/?practice-assessment-type=certification) - The most important place for the exam. Here you can find the most important information about the exam, the skills measured.
- [Microsoft study guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-900) - Just another place to learn with MS
- [Microsoft self-guided materials](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/asset/collection/microsoft-azure-fundamentals-certification-exam-az-900#/) - It is another place I need to check.
- [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular) - Another very important place to confirm the information for course and check what it the latest information.
- [Adam's Free Full Course](https://marczak.io/az-900/) - It is a fantastic source of knowledge about Azure.  Adam prepared fantastic course on YT. I am going to view it all.
- [Another YT fresh course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8n-kWJetQRk) - I don't know what to expect from this course, but I will check it out.

I think it is enough to start. I will update the list if I find something interesting or remove is anything isn't worth checking.

## What I need to know to pass AZ-900
The information I can see on the MS page is that I need to:
- describe component and services of Azure: `Compute`, `Networking`, `Storage `
- have skills in: `Infrastructure management`,`Database management`,`Software development`

but we have also some percentage values:
- Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)
- Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)
- Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)
Every of that have some subcategories. You can check all the details [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/pl-pl/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-900). 


I think we can start. If you are interested in my progress, join to the CodePruners subscribers list or just leave a comment.
