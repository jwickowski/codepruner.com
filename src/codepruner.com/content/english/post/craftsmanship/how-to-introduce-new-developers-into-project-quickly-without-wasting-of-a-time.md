- They are lost at the beginning

- They recognize the area so it...

# Consume their time
because they need to   became familiar with a product, team, solution, architecture. 


so existing developers must describe them all of these details, 
Does it bad? Not exactly it is a great opportunity to meet each other and begin some interesting discusscusions and ideas

# Risk and costs for existing project
, but there is a huge risk that something is missing because some topics could be obvious for devs with longer experience in particular project


# How to improve it?
There is an option to create a documentation and tell new devs that they need to read it. Great idea? Partially...

Not every documentation is good. How do I describe a good documentation:
- Up to date - It is the most important. When documentation is outdated there is no sense of reading it. I would be the waste of time
- Real examples - Examples are crucial to simplify understanding what we are talking about.
- Simple - If something is simpler then we are more willing to update it and read it.
- With a context - Sometimes documents were created in the past in specific situation. It is required to know the context. It allows people to understand why it is like is.
- Open for updates - Allow people to update it if it is required. They will feel, they have a real impact and they will care of it.


Ok... but how to make documentation like that? I would not suggest creating a special documentation for new people.  I would suggest using...

# ADR
It is a natural way to persist and document decision in a project. Then you will have all of advantages from ADRs. I wrote a bit about in an article about [Architecture Decision Record]({{< relref "./what-is-ADR-and-why-you-should-add-it-into-your-project.md">}}).

Moreover, you add it as a step in a project's introduction. New devs should read it one by one and then:
- They will know what approaches are in the project
- They will know the context of some decisions from the past
- They will be asked to comment any of that decision, maybe they have better solution to described problems
- They will have real examples in the code
- They will know what assumptions are, se they would be able to follow them
- They will know how to introduce new ideas into the project to improve it


# Would you like to add anything?
If no - leave here a comment and tell me what do you prefer coffe of tea?
If yes - leave a comment or create a PR to that [post in GitHub](AddAPAthToThatPost)





You should have an updated documentation, with real examples, and with a 



- User guide - gread idea
The best option is create 

Start using [ADR]({{< relref "./what-is-ADR-and-why-you-should-add-it-into-your-project.md">}}) 

  - Other developers time, because they need to describe everything
