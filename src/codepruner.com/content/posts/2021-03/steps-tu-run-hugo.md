## My expetiation
I thought I would install hugo, add a post and I could publish new great blog, but...

## It is a bit more complicated
Becaouse it a tool and everyone has to get a bit of knowleadge about to work effectively. To run it you have to:
* Install Hugo - obvious
* Generate a new site with `hugo new site {sitename}`
* Add a post
* Add a theme. They suggest to add it as git submodule. I don't like submodules, but if it a standard way I am going to go that path.
* Change names in config file
