## It is not my first blog
I have been present in the internet since 2016 year. I have blog [JerzyWickowski.pl](https://jerzywickowski.pl) and [Blog.DeployAacademy.pl](https://blog.deployacademy.pl/). 

Both of them are using Wordpress and I still have to tell that wordpress is great, but there are some cons:
 * It is difficoult customize, because there are mass of code around
 * It isn't simple to recreate
   * To restore backup of old version
   * To create new instance, for test purposes for examle
 * It requires updating plugins all the time
 * It requires internet connection to work on new posts
 * Working on Wordpress editor make me nervous. 
   * Classic one is too lov level
   * Gutenberg is too slow and not conforrtable is i want to copy or move semething

So I decides to find... 

## An alternative
I have multiple options:
* I can write my on blog engine
  * But it will take me a lot of time
  * I don't have soo much free time to write something like this
