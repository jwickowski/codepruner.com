  * To improve my language skills
  * To write worlkwide
* Write often
  * Posts don't have to be perfect
  * Write shorter posts, but more regular
* Write about daily basis problems 
  * To help you solving similar problems faster
  * To help miself solving similar problems faster
* Show problems and solve them
  * There will be code snippets
  * There will be ideas
  * There will be some good practice of my adventures :)
* Write using static page generated
  * To simplify writing process
  * To have safe backup
  * To be able to recreate blog automatically
