We are nine months after starting of the blog. I wrote some main ideas in the [1st posts]({{< relref "./welcome-on-CodePruner.md">}}). All of them are active, but I have clarified some ideas and concepts in higher level. I would like to share it with you and write it for myself in the future. 

# Types of blogs
We can split blogs into two categories:
1. Blogs about nothing and about everything in the same time.
    - Just to write, just to share some ideas. 
    - Without any structure or longer plans.
    - Without the main concept about content category
2. Blogs with a clear view and for specific niche.
    - To write articles in some specified topics
    - To be a place with professional knowledge in specified areas
    - With some vision to help people with the same problems

All blogs I have created in the past they were in the 1st group(maybe expect one, but the topic was not good for me), but now I think I have a clear vision about the purpose of that place

# The main concept
Let's start with the name: `Code Pruner`. 
- `Code`:
  - Of course it is technical so we will talk about code and some technical stuff
- `Pruner`- It is a gardening tool for there are some gardening metaphors:
  - A pruner is a tool to cut branches.
  - A pruner is a person that trim or prune plants
  - They prune to shape growth of plants. 
    - Some branches have to be cut to allow others, more important parts, to grow. 
    - They cut old, dried and useless branches to give more sun for others
    - They cut old plants to have better harvest
  - They work in longer perspective.
    - They prune apple trees in late winter to have better apples in autumn
    - They prune raspberries one year to have fruits in next to have fruits next year
    - They cut old and sick parts to save others
    - They cut some parts in very young trees to shape the tree crown in ten or more years.
  - They know that `A Stitch In Time Saves Nine`
- `Code Pruner`
  - When you connect these two words you will guess some ideas.
  - We need to cut some part of code to allow then for health growth
  - We need to think about refactor in long perspective
    - Sometimes months, sometimes years
    - Sometimes we don't know the final result, but we need to go to correct direction
  - Development, like gardening, is not only about creating new things (like seeding)
    - We need to take care of our job
    - We need to monitor our fields
    - We need to deliver it
    - We need to work with our team
    - We need to cooperate with other people
  - In shorten: `How to develop and deliver faster with better quality`

# The implementation 
So when we have the main idea of the blog we can go to ordinary things. I am going to write articles in categories:
- `Craftsmanship`
  - In that category we will talk about: Quality, CleanCode, Designs Patterns, Developer Workshop, Architecture
  - and how to improve our work to be able to focus on the most important areas
- `CI/CD`
    - At the beginning it will be subcategory in Craftsmanship, but maybe it will change in the future
    - How and why configure CI/CD process to allow to wo work more effectively
    - But we will not talk about all of DevOps stuff, we will look at CI/CD from team and developer perspective
- `Refactoring`
  - It is required to have good velocity in long term.
  - I will write about some tips and tricks in refactoring
  - How to refactor even if everyone things there is not time for this
  - How to do it safety
  - How to do in continuously
- `Technologies`
  - It is nice to write and read about idea, but we need to develop it
  - Se we need some information about concrete technologies, languages, frameworks, etc.
  - It will be split for frontend and backend, but maybe something different in the future
    - Maybe it would be better to split it by technologies. We will see.
    - And I creating a blog with Hugo. So there will be place for articles about Hugo too.
- `Teamwork`
  - Developer work is not only about creating code. We can say that it is only a small part of it.
  - We need to talk with people. Yes it is true, with multiple types of people: other developers, managers, users, PMs, business people
  - Sometimes we need to write some documents to improve cooperations
  - We will talk about some tricks and approaches how to improve team work to improve velocity
- `Ideas`
  - I will write about some ideas that I have in my mind and they will be related with my activity, but not very technical. Like that post.

# Summarize
Ok. So here it the plan.

Would you like to read about something specific?
Let me know and leave a comment :)
