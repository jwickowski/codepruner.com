ADR is an Architecture Decision Record, but if we leave it like that, it won't tell you anything. So let's deconstruct the name into smaller pieces.  

# Deconstructing ADR

## Architecture Decision
I like to describe it as: "Every decision in the development team that has an impact on the state of the application and the way of working in a particular time". 

Ok... we have it, but here are some examples:
- Use TypeScript and React on the frontend
- Create backend in .NET
- Create the application for a cloud. Try by agnostic if you can, but currently, we will use AWS
- Let's use Feature Toggles

The above decisions are simple, but usually, we need to decide to be done in the middle of the work. For example:
- New frontend files should be created in TypeScript and if you require touching a JavaScript file, then migrate it to TS and add typings
  - The decision can be made when a current app is in JS and when we want to start migrating to TS, but without stopping current development
  - The decision can be connected with a different one about `ongoing refactoring`
- Stop using `MomentJs`, start using `date-fns`
  - The decision can be made when devs discover that `MomentJs` is no longer supported

But some decisions can be not so technical. They can be about the way of working:
- Use Trunk Based Development instead of GitFlow
- Every merge to master should be reviewed on CodeReview

## Record
It is a place where we store documents. In our case, it is a place where we will store Architectural Decisions.

# Why we require  ADR
When we know what is ADR, we should be aware why we need it.
- It forces analyzing multiple options and alternatives. It is good, because it allows us to decide better.
- We have to consider pros and cons of that decision. There is no decision with pros only. It is good to know what can go wrong with it.
- It initiates constructive conversations and interrupts worthless discussions. When we create a certain ADR, then a lot of discussion needs to be done to make every team member happy, but after it, everything is known. Then we stop wasting time on discussing between spaces and tabs.
- It allows future developers to understand what decision was made, what was the context. So they will have better understanding of the code, and they will know limitation from the past.
- It allows introducing new developers faster, because a lot of knowledge is in ADRs. So they will be able to understand architecture easier
- It allows going in straight destination, because a lot of topics will be shared there

# What it should contain
There are a lot of items that should be in one ADR. Some of them are mandatory, some of them are optional:
- Title
  - It's obvious
- Date of creation of the decision
  - It allows people to know when it was created to have better context
- Context
  - A description of current situation. Every decision has a context, so it is a must. Allow people in the future to understand your current situation.
- Status
  - Every decision has a status. It can be Accepted, Rejected, Canceled or in a Draft. 
- Alternatives
  - To show people that you have considered alternatives and describe what they weren't chosen
- Pros and cons
  - Every decision has advantages and disadvantages. Describe it. It allows people in the future to respect that decision.
- Decision
  - The most important part. Write what is the decision. 

# What format it should be
They are different approaches what is the best format of it, but I would suggest you:

- Don't create your own standard. Use a standard one, and keep it simple
  - I recommend [MADR](https://github.com/adr/madr)
  - If you need something different, check it on [GitHub](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record)
- Keep it in the same repository as code
  - You will have a history
  - You would be able to discuss in standard way (Pull Requests)
  - No one will search it
- Use Markdown
  - It is easy to write
  - It is easy to read
  - It is easy to generate a webpage based to publish it 

# Do you have ADR in your project?
I am sure that in every project you were, a decision like that was done. By someone or by a team, but the question is if they were written and why we should do this.... and it is a path to the next point...
